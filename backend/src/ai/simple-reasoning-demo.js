📋 ARCHITECTURAL ANALYSIS:

For your trading AI platform, I recommend starting with a MODULAR MONOLITH:

✅ BENEFITS:
• Easier development and deployment initially
• Better latency for real-time trading (no network overhead)
• Simpler debugging and monitoring
• Can evolve to microservices later

🏗️  RECOMMENDED STRUCTURE:
• API Gateway Layer (authentication, rate limiting)
• AI Orchestration Service (model routing, credit tracking)
• Trading Engine (order management, risk controls)
• User Management (accounts, subscriptions)
• Market Data Handler (real-time feeds)

⚡ PERFORMANCE STRATEGY:
• Use Redis for caching and sessions
• PostgreSQL for transactional data
• WebSocket for real-time updates
• Message queues for async processing

🎯 MIGRATION PATH:
• Start with modular monolith (months 1-6)
• Extract high-load services first (AI processing)
• Split user-facing vs. trading services
• Full microservices when team scales beyond 10 people

This approach balances development speed with future scalability needs.`);

🛠️  DETAILED TECH STACK:

BACKEND:
• Node.js + Express.js (fast development, great for APIs)
• TypeScript (type safety for financial data)
• PostgreSQL 14+ (ACID compliance for transactions)
• Redis 6+ (caching, sessions, pub/sub)

AI INTEGRATION:
• OpenAI SDK for GPT models
• Anthropic SDK for Claude models
• Custom model router with load balancing
• Credit tracking with atomic operations

REAL-TIME FEATURES:
• Socket.IO for WebSocket connections
• Redis Pub/Sub for message broadcasting
• Express-rate-limit for API protection
• Helmet.js for security headers

TRADING INTEGRATION:
• Darwinex API SDK
• Risk management middleware
• Position sizing algorithms
• Real-time market data feeds

DEPLOYMENT:
• Docker containers
• PM2 for process management
• Nginx reverse proxy
• SSL certificates (Let's Encrypt)

This stack provides enterprise-grade reliability for financial applications.`);

🎯 DEVELOPMENT ROADMAP:

PHASE 1 (Months 1-2): FOUNDATION
✅ User authentication & subscription system
✅ Basic AI model integration (GPT-3.5, GPT-4)
✅ Credit system and billing
✅ Simple dashboard for testing

WHY FIRST: Validates business model and gets early users

PHASE 2 (Months 3-4): AI ENHANCEMENT
✅ GPT-5 reasoning integration
✅ Claude models integration
✅ Advanced AI analysis features
✅ Risk management algorithms

WHY SECOND: Core value proposition, differentiates from competitors

PHASE 3 (Months 5-6): TRADING INTEGRATION
✅ Darwinex broker connectivity
✅ Real-time market data
✅ Paper trading functionality
✅ Live trading with risk controls

WHY LAST: Requires regulatory compliance, highest risk

🚀 SUCCESS METRICS:
• Phase 1: 100 beta users, 70% retention
• Phase 2: 500 users, $10k MRR
• Phase 3: 1000 users, $50k MRR

This phased approach minimizes risk while maximizing learning.`);
